Hello! My name is **Dolapo Okuboyejo** and I’m in my third year of university studying 3D Animation and VFX. Over my time at university, I’ve developed a love for the more technical side of the industry, I realised I enjoy the process of figuring out solutions in a more procedural manner which has made me lean towards pipeline development and FX. I'm hoping to further devlop my skills in these 2 departments during my time in th eindustry and hope to become a CG supe one day!

Aside from this however I did also specialise in rigging for my 2nd year film which you can see [here](https://www.therookies.co/entries/37110)!
