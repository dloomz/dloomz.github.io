**Eye to Eye** was my 2nd year thesis film that followed a tattered toy, missing an eye.


## My Role

During the process of creating this film I had multiple roles, such as:

- Rigging 
- Pipeline
- Data Wrangler
- Film Branding

## Rigging

I had wanted to explore the role of a rigger more after choosing it as an elective during Semester A of my second year. It came with an array of challenges and I learnt a lot more about the technical side of Maya, including the node view.
